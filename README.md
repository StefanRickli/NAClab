# NAClab

This repository preserves the computational MATLAB package **NAClab** (Numerical Algebraic Computing Toolbox) and its accompanying website content, originally created by Dr. Zhonggang Zeng and collaborators. The aim of this project is to make this valuable tool and its documentation accessible to the community after the original website became unreachable.

## Documentation

The complete hosted documentation can be accessed here:

## Purpose

NAClab is a powerful research toolbox for solving advanced numerical algebraic problems, with applications in polynomial systems, linear transformations, nonlinear systems, and more. Its unique capabilities include:

- Solving hypersensitive problems from empirical data.
- Performing polynomial computations with a WYSIWYG interface.
- Directly solving rank-deficient linear operator equations.
- Handling nonlinear systems with singular Jacobians and non-isolated solutions.

This repository is a **community preservation project**. Any missing documents, images, or code fragments that you can contribute are highly welcome.

## Summary of NAClab

### Key Features:

- **Polynomial systems**: Solve complex polynomial systems using homotopy methods.
- **Linear operator equations**: Solve equations without explicit matrix representations.
- **Nonlinear systems**: Use rank-r Newton's iteration for singular systems.
- **Numerical tools**: Compute polynomial GCD, factorization, and more.

### Example Modules:

1. **LinearSolve**: Solve linear operator equations \( L(z) = b \), even for rank-deficient operators.
2. **psolve**: Solve polynomial systems with numerical solutions.
3. **Polynomial manipulation**: Perform operations like addition, multiplication, evaluation, GCD computation, and factorization.

For more examples and details, see the [hosted NAClab documentation](https://stefanrickli.github.io/NAClab/).
