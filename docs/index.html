    <h1>NAClab</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the NAClab project page! This repository is dedicated to preserving the <b>Numerical Algebraic Computing Toolbox</b> for MATLAB, originally developed by Dr. Zhonggang Zeng and collaborators. NAClab offers powerful tools for solving advanced numerical algebraic problems, ranging from polynomial computations to nonlinear system solving, with applications in scientific research and engineering.</p>

    <h2>About NAClab</h2>
    <p>NAClab is a comprehensive research toolbox that excels at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solving hypersensitive problems from empirical data.</li>
        <li>Performing intuitive WYSIWYG polynomial computations in MATLAB.</li>
        <li>Directly solving rank-deficient linear operator equations.</li>
        <li>Handling nonlinear systems with singular Jacobians and non-isolated solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This repository is a community-driven effort to preserve and share the NAClab software and its documentation, ensuring its continued accessibility after the original website became unreachable. Contributions of missing documents, images, or code fragments are highly welcome.</p>
